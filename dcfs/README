Dcfs is a simple read-only filesystem for Plan9.  It is useful for
some cameras based on the Fujitsu chipset with TWAIN protocol over a
serial connection.

All the low level routines for talking to the camera and what
registers to look at and poke at are supplied in the PhotoPC package.
PhotoPC is the work of Eugene G.  Crosser and Bruce D.  Lightner.

Charles Forsyth's ported of PhotoPC to Plan9, and the files eph.c and
eph_io.h come from this package.  Forsyth's Software page has the
complete photopc port:

The fs part is my doing.  Send the bug reports to me: fst@9netics.com
As usual, you can do what you want with the parts I've written, but
don't come crying to me if something doesn't work â˜º
Dcfs has only been tested on a Sanyo VPC-X360.

The eventual goal is to have an fs with this general layout:

	ctl	# for commands to the camera -- eventually
	pics/
		pic01
		pic02
		...
	seqs/
		seq01/
		seq02/
		...
	clips/
		clip01
		clip02
		...

Reading ctl should perhaps return the camera ID information, etc.
commands that can be written to ctl should be:
	snap		- take a snapshot
	bitrate xxx	- set port speed
	port xxx		- ??? set to a different port. Not sure about this
	maxretry xxx	- maximum retry count to contact the camera
	???

for now, it just builds the tree upfront based on the current number
of images in the camera, and makes a read-only directory of the
still images.  by not supplying the close service function, the buffers for
the actual content will be around after the first read, a type of
caching.
